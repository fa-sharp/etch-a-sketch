Assignment from the [Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/etch-a-sketch-project)
- User can sketch in the grid using their mouse, or touch on mobile
- Grid has a fixed visual size, but user can customize the number of cells up to 100*100
- Plain Javascript and CSS

Thanks to [this StackOverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/43687046) from Michael Benjamin, for helping
